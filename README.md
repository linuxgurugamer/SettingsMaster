## Settings Master

Fixes stock bug when there are too many settings pages.  

There is a bug on the stock Settings screen which shows up if you have too many mods installed which add their own pages to the Settings screen.  This can break a game if you happen to go into the settings screen when you have too many mods.  This mod is designed to work around the bug by disabling some of the settings pages before you go there. 

## Features

- At startup, automatically hides enough settings pages to reduce the number of settings pages to no more than 16
- If less than or equal to 16 settings pages, the Settings manager will remove it self as not needed
- Button to show all
- Button to hide all
- Toggle to put the toolbar button for the mod onto the Blizzy toolbar, if available.  Currently this options is NOT saved
- If more than 16 settings pages have been enabled, will automatically hide enough to reduce the number of settings pages to no more than 16

## Future Plans
- Open the Settings page directly and eliminate the need to have to drill down  through the stock settings screens.
- Save the setting for the Blizzy Toolbar

## Dependencies
- Click Through Blocker
- ToolbarController
- CKAN has been updated to install the dependencies, if needed.
